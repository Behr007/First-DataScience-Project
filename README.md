This project looks at publicly available data (Ontario's electricity market data, as recorded by Independent Electricity System Operator - IESO for short - available for download on ieso.ca website) and aims to build three Machine Learning models.

Price variability, is a feature of North America's electricity markets. Reducing electricity use during peak hours can reduce consumers' electricity bill.
Utilizing a Machine Learning model, if coupled with an Internet of Things device which could "read" prices frm ieso website and execute the model in real-time, could not only reduce consumers' electricity bills;
but it also provides the opportunity to further reduce cost of utilizng energy storage units was viable.

A Machine Learning model that can forecast both low-cost hours and high-cost hours, can be coupled with an energy storage unit, and thus, autonomously buy electricity when it's cheap and store it. And then disconnect the consumer from the grid when prices go above normal and allow the consumer to continue using electricity 
by allowing it to flow from storage to devices that need it.
